# Java-Spring-Boot-Assignment
I have created a get api to fetch all the data from the mysql database. To use this, just create only database with name "student_information". Then Run the project, it automatically create "student" table in the "student_information" database.

## use postman to test the APIs.

Get api :- http://localhost:9090/detail

And i have also implemented one more api which is post api to add the data in the student table.

Post api - http://localhost:9090/addstudent
